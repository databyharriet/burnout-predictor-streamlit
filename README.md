# 🧠 Burnout Predictor - Streamlit App

This is a Machine Learning-powered Streamlit app designed to predict the likelihood of burnout in employees based on workplace-related factors such as workload, mental fatigue, and job satisfaction. It provides an interactive, data-driven solution that visualizes correlations and allows for real-time prediction using a trained model.

## 🚀 Live Demo

> [COMING SOON] – You can deploy this app on **Streamlit Cloud** or **Hugging Face Spaces** for a public link!

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project aims to detect **employee burnout risk** using data-driven insights. It allows:

- 🧾 Visualization of training data
- 📊 Correlation matrix for feature understanding
- 🧠 Real-time burnout risk prediction using a trained ML model
- 📦 Simple and clean UI built with Streamlit

---

## 🖼️ App Interface

The app has the following sections:

- 📈 Data Preview & Correlation
- 🎯 Input Form for Predictions
- 📉 Burnout Risk Result (Yes/No)
- 🛠️ Footer with tool info

---

## 🧠 Machine Learning Model Info

- **Model Used**: Logistic Regression (or your model of choice)
- **Training Data**: `train.csv`
- **Scaler Used**: `StandardScaler()` from scikit-learn
- **Saved Models**:  
  - `model.pkl` – trained classifier  
  - `scaler.pkl` – trained scaler used for input preprocessing

> The model was trained to classify burnout risk as either `Yes` or `No` based on input features.

## 💻 How to Run Locally

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/databyharriet/burnout-predictor-streamlit.git
cd burnout-predictor-streamlit
2. Create a Virtual Environment (Optional but recommended)
bash
Copy
Edit
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate  # For Windows
# OR
source venv/bin/activate  # For macOS/Linux
3. Install Requirements
bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
4. Run the App
bash
Copy
Edit
streamlit run app.py
The app will launch in your browser at http://localhost:8501

🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used
Streamlit – For the web UI

scikit-learn – For building and saving the model

pandas – For data handling

pickle – For saving models

📊 Sample Input Features
These are the features you can input for predictions (modify based on your data):

Age

Gender

Education Level

Mental Fatigue Level

Workload

Job Satisfaction

Sleep Quality

Stress Level

Other workplace-related variables...

✅ Example Prediction Output
Burnout Prediction: 🔴 Yes
(Based on mental fatigue = high, workload = high, sleep quality = poor)
